## Introduction

This is a collection of assorted resources about my relations who, as part of the [Chinese diaspora](https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/overseas-chinese-long-history-0) of the 19th Century, departed Southern China and eventually settled in what is currently recognised as Papua New Guinea. 

Following the relaxation of the [White Australia Policy](https://www.nma.gov.au/defining-moments/resources/white-australia-policy#:~:text=On%2023%20December%201901%20the,non%2DBritish%20migration%20to%20Australia.) in the 1950s and [PNG's independence in 1975](https://www.naa.gov.au/help-your-research/fact-sheets/independence-papua-new-guinea), younger generations of PNG-born Chinese began to migrate to Australia. My family is included in the contingent that received Australian citizenship and emigrated from PNG in the 1970s.

Whilst there exists an abundance of information about the PNG Chinese, my aim is to highlight my family's history and weave it into the backdrop of what's already been chronicled. This is an extension of a personal project to digitise my extensive family tree, building upon work that has occurred over the past decade by persons within and independent of my family. To note, [Gabriel Chow Ying](https://github.com/darrenpng/png-resources/blob/main/texts/Correspondence%20to%20Pacific%20Administration.md) is my great-grandfather and due to what is seemingly a genetic virility, is also the ancestor of many others.

The material provided in this repository are from personal records, type-written letters, esoteric texts, photocopies of photocopies etc. I have (roughly) transcribed a number of these resources so they're now available in digital format for further use. 

Should you wish to dive deeper into the history there's a list of publicly available resources below however I endeavour to make what I can accessible here.


## Why?

Being born in Australia, I am removed from the experiences that my parents (and their elders) had in PNG. I wanted to understand this history further and ensure that some of it is recorded before this becomes an impossible task.

Much of this knowledge is fragmented; stored as loose documents in frayed manilla folders or survive as fractured memories that are mentioned on occasion. I desire to save some of these stories before they're forgotten. 

It's additionally important to make this information highly accessible (and digestible) for whoever wants to read this in future.
