## A Brief History

During the 19th Century there was increasing interest in the New Guinea region from European nations with a history of colonial conquest.

In the 1870s and 1880s, German commercial firms began their foray into New Guinea. For the Germans, New Guinea was basically a business venture. Thousands of local workers were hired as cheap labor on cocoa and copra plantations.

In 1883, following a short-lived French annexation of New Ireland, the British Colony of Queensland annexed south-eastern New Guinea to the disapproval of superiors in the United Kingdom who refused to ratify the annexation. 

Significant change occurred in eastern New Guinea in 1884 as the German and British / Australian contingents staked their claims for land.

The **New Guinea Company** was founded in Berlin in 1884 for the purpose of colonising and exploiting resources on *Neuguinea*. This expedition was with the knowledge and blessing of the German Chancellor, Count Otto von Bismarck. The goal was to select land for plantation development on the north-east coast of New Guinea and establish trading posts.

On the 19th August, Chancellor Bismarck ordered the establishment of a German protectorate in the New Britain Archipelago and north-eastern New Guinea, known as **German New Guinea** (later named **Kaiser-Wilhelmsland**), which formed the first part of the German colonial empire. When Germany began claiming these settlements in the north, the United Kingdom established a British protectorate on the 6th November in the south-eastern quarter of New Guinea that Queensland had previously annexed, named **British New Guinea**. 

In 1902, British New Guinea was transferred to the authority of Australia and with the passage of the Papua Act 1905, the area was officially renamed the **Territory of Papua**.

At the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, Australia invaded Kaiser-Wilhelmsland on 11 September 1914 with 2000 volunteers of the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force. After several skirmishes, the Australians succeeded in capturing the German colony, which they occupied for the rest of the war. The Treaty of Versailles in 1919 transferred German New Guinea to Australia, which administered it as the **Territory of New Guinea**.

This arrangement temporarily ceased in 1941 when the Japanese invaded New Guinea shortly after the start of the Pacific War. Civil administration of Papua and New Guinea was restored in 1945 at the end of the Japanese occupation. The Papua and New Guinea Act 1949 united the Territory of Papua and Territory of New Guinea as the **Territory of Papua and New Guinea**.

On 13 December 1971 the name of the territory was changed to Papua New Guinea, and independence was ultimately achieved on 16 September 1975 during the Whitlam government's tenure.
