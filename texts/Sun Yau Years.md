## 1948 - 1952: Sun Yau Years

### Prelude

We remember or we re-call from hearsay or reading. What follows is probably is combination of these and various factors.

I can clearly visualize myself running around Olobo Plantation, but I do not remember the boat that brought us there. I remember tracking to didiman concentration camp & sleeping under "Arrow- Root" leaves hut on the way. Few episodes are still clear in my memory: Thatched huts burning with melted coin destroyed by Yankee planes; living along the river under tropical forest canopy; searching for crabs, bivalve marine shells along the mangrove seafront or along the river. School started in the cave: learning Japanese language and Japanese songs: "OR DER DER OU YA-I DER" and the war ended August 1945.

Namatanai was where I started my schooling for one or two months before we could get on a boat to Rabaul: There I learned half a dozen Chinese songs and at least three I can still remember: The Mainland China National Anthem, the Kuomintang Anthem and the Shanghai Farewell Love Song. Was it Mr. Stephen Lau who taught us there? We started school in 1946 as a non denominal school, combined Methodist, Catholic and others under Government Auspices in Rabaul, somewhere in Matupit areas. At the beginning of 1947, there must have been discussions to restart the Yang Ching School or a Catholic School. I often wonder why the Yang Ching School was never restarted and rebuilt with war compensation fund. This was invested and later was the source for the support of the Sacred Heart School. Someone will probably write a chapter on Yang Ching School Investment Fund. Someone will write a chapter on the start of the Sacred Heart School in June 1947.

It was amazing how quickly the Chinese could send their children to Australia in 1948. I vividly remember the gathering at Matupit Airport, students were tardy and parents seemingly reluctant to let the students to get on the DC 3 Plane. What a sad farewell, buckets of tears were shed. Collection of photos at the airport vividly engraved the sadness on the faces of so many. But when we left for Australia at the beginning of 1953, I did not recollect tears were shed for us.

In the early years after the war, even a year or two in Australia; quite easily guaranteed the teenager a job in Rabaul because of their seeming fluency in English.

It was not long before the upper Primary school and commercial classes were relocated 10 Malaguna Road. The classes were mainly run by the Daughters of Our Lady of the Sacred Heart: one Pre-war Chinese Teacher, Mr. Chan went back to Hong Kong. A new teacher, Mr. Wong joined Stephen Lau. Both of these would leave when the Chinese, Marist brothers came (1949). Brother Hu taught Cantonese, and Brother Anthony Chang taught English. He and two other Chinese Brothers could speak Mandarin but not Cantonese. They were involved with Administration at this time. It was unfortunate we did not see learning Mandarin could have been more beneficial for business in the late 20th century and thereafter.

### Interlude

Before I continue the main years of my recollection, I wish to insert an interlude in memory of those who had so sharply influenced our Christian, spiritual and our human lives. The three most conspicuous would no doubt be Mr. John Achai, Mr. Chow Ying and Gabriel Achun. Others were shining examples: Mr. Chan (Vincent's father), Mr. Choi.

Where would we find today Catholics who would walk two or three miles daily to attend mass at 6.30am. These old gentlemen did so until they were in their late 70's. Achun's family normally drove to mass. I am sure they would put us to shame. We regularly failed even on Sunday with our modern cars to take us. Their interest in the church, schools and people were outstanding. They actively throughout their lives preached and convert their compatriots to be Catholics. Mr. Achai had given six of his children to God's vine yard.

1. Fr _ RIP (Chan)
2. Fr _ RIP (Chan) (Diocesan)
3. Sister Elisabeth (Chan)
4. Sister Rosita Chan (Catherine)
5. Sister Mary
6. Fr Albert Chan

Mr. Gabriel Chow Ying had two grandchildren who spent some years in spreading the gospel: Fr Raphael Chow and previously Fr Joseph M. Chow MSC - 1965-1975. Fr Ray Chow spent over 30 years dedicated service to the church in the Diocese of Rabaul. He passed away 5 years ago. Fr Joseph taught at Monivae College, Hamilton, Victoria for two years. He worked as a Missionary of the Sacred Heart in the Diocese of Alotau for 8½ years. He resigned in June 1975.

For a small Chinese Catholic population of 2000, it had been an amazing story that so many had gone to try to enter the Vineyard of the Lord.

- Pre-war: John Achai's two priest sons, a daughter - a nun
- In 1948: his two other daughters - Therese and Catherine joined

### The Sacred Heart School

1948 - 1952 were the inauguration of the Marist Brothers years' of the Sacred Heart School. From the student perspective these could be term the Sun Yau Years.

By 1948 the students who resumed classes after the war interrupted years had practically completed their schoolings and some went to boarding school in Australia. Some of the girls continued commercial classes under Sister Editha. Others began their adult life in public employments or family businesses.

The class under Joseph Chow Sun Yau assumed the roll of senior students from 1948. We were a class made up of students who did not start school before the war and those who did not start school during the years 1942 - 1945.

We made up one huge class which included 2 brothers, brother & sister, sister & sisters in the same class and one student had two siblings in the same class. At the beginning of the Sacred Heart School, June 1947 - we had over sixty students in our class. The Daughters of Our Lady of the Sacred Heart were our teachers for our main formal subjects for primary classes:

**1948 - 1952**

- Sister Michael, FDNSC - the loveable old battle axe
- Sister Editha, FDNSC - our commercial teacher
- Sister Edward, FDNSC - our music teacher
- Sister Flavia, FDNSC
- Sister Thaddaeus, FDNSC
- Sister St Paul, FDNSC
- Sister Josette, FDNSC
- Sister Michael, FDNSC (?)
- Sister John Baptist (Music)

The Daughters of Our Lady of The Sacred Heart had a tremendous influence on us. The students were so receptive on the message of St Bernadette of Soubirou; the message of our Lady of Fatima: these were embraced with fervour. It was normal for students to ride by bikes or walk to morning masses on a daily basis. It was good to see the children of Mary dressed in blue on special occasions. We were an edifying lot. I would vouch nearly every student would have attended more than two days a week for mass - some attended almost daily year after year.

We took the message of Lourdes quite seriously - attend nine first Fridays of the month, we would be guaranteed heaven. It was a naive easy route to heaven. We did not question such devotion and belief. I suppose if we are faithful to God, nine months of a year we probably would not forget God and his commandments. Such devotion to God did bear fruit with a substantial number who chose to give of their lives to God, church and fellowmen.

Fr. T. Ormonde, MSC, Fr. JM Dwyer MSC of the Australian province and Fr Stephen White MSC of the Irish province provided us with pastoral guidance in these years.

### Sports in Sacred Heart School

We had school sports of basketball, soccer, baseball and tennis. I recalled it was not until the Australia Marist Brothers came that former team sports were introduced. At this time also, under the Australia Marist Brothers the school was divided into boys and girls schools. The boys teams were divided into blue, gold, red and white. Many took turn to be captains: Paul Chan, David Seeto, Joe Sun Yau and others. (Joe Chan)

When organized sports were introduced in the boy's school, brother Ervan, headmaster and brother Philip sports master began to teach some of us leadership in sports and school. I recollect the girls school also have their sports teams organized. Social sports between public (Methodist) school and Malay school were introduced in 1949.

Brother Ervan slowly groomed us to be leaders. He appointed Joseph Chow captain of the school. I assumed this roll from 1950 until I went to Australia early in 1953.

### Inter-school Sports

Brother Ervan appointed me as captain of all sport teams in 1951 and again in 1952. Joseph suggested to Brother Ervan to let Paul Chan be captain of basketball but brother did not.

Formal inter school weekly sport competition began in 1950 with three school participations. Sacred Heart school, Malay school and public school (Methodist). The sports we participated in were tennis, soccer, basketball and baseball. In the first year the Sacred Heart School teams A & B were no match to the Methodist School. But we usually beat the Malay School. However after one year of losing streaks in nearly all sports, we were able to reach an ascendancy in 1951. I remember the first time we beat them in soccer against the Methodist "A" team: it must have been over 30 metre out that I back kicked the soccer ball and scored the winning goal. This marked the beginning of triumph under me as captain. Uncle Simon Chow was so elated and gave me my first pay dirt of fifty pounds. It was a moment I would never forget as a youngster. (Beating the Methodist was a huge episode in those racist bigotry days.)

In soccer, outstanding in the forwards were no doubt, Joe Chow (Sheung), the Woo Duo - Michael and Stephen, Joe Chan and of course centre left, Joe Sun Yau. David Seeto and Bruno Seeto on the wings.

In the mid field and back, Alfred Woo, Stephen Woo, and Gerard Seeto were outstanding. Lucius Chow - goal keeper. We were a formidable team against the Methodist and Malays. Most of the soccer team players also represented the school in basketball and baseball and achieved equal success against our foes in both these sports.

The tennis A team was only a small contingent: Joseph M. Chow (Capt.) Michael Woo, Stephen Woo, Joe and Lucius Chow, Alfred Woo and Mathew Ning. We were also the successful teams for 1951 and 1952. The B teams in 1952 in all the sports were slowly improving and eventually in subsequent years were successful. Tennis consumed a lot of our time. Often we played from 3:30 - 6:30 pm during school days. At the weekends we played school competition. In 1951 & 1952, some of us older students participated in the Rabaul Senior Tennis Competition.

It was unfortunate we never had any professional coaching. Some learned from whatever tennis books were available in the Rabaul Public Library.

### 1952 Junior Tennis Championships

As far as I can remember we had the following championships: 14 & under, 16 & under and 18 & under. Joseph M Chow after a very hard tussle only just overcame the cunning spin play of Matthew Ning. Joe became the first 18 & under champion, the latter took the runner-up trophy. In the doubles it may have been Joseph Chow and Matthew Ning who took the crown for the 18 & under. I have not enquired whether any junior championships were held after 1952.

Soccer and other sports continued after 1953. But I heard the rivalry between the Catholics and Methodists were not controlled after our departures and eventually inter-school sports were abandoned due to violence & brawling on the sports fields.

Sports were not just sports. It was there we boys played extra well to impress the girls when they were present. And in those days the girls who were the favorites of the boys were, Rita Seeto, Winnie Choi, Colette Seeto, Margaret Seeto, Cecilia Woo and Eulalie Woo. The most popular haunts for us to gather and discuss sports, girls and our school misdemeanours were, E. Achok's home, Stephen and Michael's place and Alfie Woo place. There were two young girls who were my favorites with an initial of "H" and "J". The only love letter I wrote before I went to the seminary was to a girl with an "H" initial - don't blush. My next love letters were not written until I met a girl called Avelina in 1976.

### Racial Battle

When I went to Sacred Heart Apostolic School in 1953. I did not return to Papua New Guinea for two years & did not see my parents for that length of time. In the Christmas of 1954 I returned and found I almost forgotten how to speak Chinese. I also found the antipathy of Catholics & Methodists was simmering. There was raging battle in the baseball field of Queen's Park. Those who had engaged in this kind of battle were well prepared: Full rockets armament, battle coats (wet raincoats) Protective eye goggles.

Joseph M Chow went into battle unprepared. Firecrackers hurled at one another, rocket flares flying pass each other. It was something exhilarating and manly until an accident occurred. One of these flares hit Joseph M. Chow on his unprotected face and just missed his eyes. That was the final of my battle engagement. I did not engage in anymore skirmishes in subsequent years. I did not enquire whether there were subsequent annual battles when the students returned from Australia.

The Sacred Heart School had already been moving towards a multi-racial school and not a predominantly Chinese School in 1952. The flow of students to Australia also seems to change the attitude regarding learning of Chinese. When the Chinese Marist Brothers left PNG, it seemed no serious attempts were made to recruit new Chinese teachers for the Sacred Heart School. However, some maintained it was the Australian Government which forbid the teaching of Chinese in the Sacred Heart School: a big loss to future generation of Rabaul Born Chinese. The younger generation picked up rudimentary village. Chinese dialect at home. So many did not.

### Academic Programmes

Under the Daughters of Our Lady of The Sacred Heart, the boys and girls were groomed to attain commercial certifications in book-keeping and business. Already we were participating in Queensland book-keeping and typing examination in 1950. But when the Australian Marist Brothers came, the curriculum in 1951 - 1952 we re-arranged to qualify for study of NSW secondary curriculum, should any student decide to go to Australia. Midst 1951 when some of us wrote in an essay we wanted to be a priest, brother Ervan S.M. introduced Jack Seeto and Joseph to study of Latin.

In the years 1950, 1951 and 1952, those who excelled in the academic field in selective subjects were the following: Winnie Choi, David Seeto, Raphael Chow, Mathew Ning and Joseph M. Chow. In Chinese it was often a tussle of Joe Chow, Winnie or David. Dux of the class for 1950 and 1951 was Joseph San Yau. Raphael Chow took the honour in 1952, runner-up Joe Sun Yau. In 1953 a big number of our class departed for Australian schools. Others started their employment in Papua New Guinea.

Raphael Chow was supposed to enter a seminary in 1953 - but his mum wanted him to do high school first. He completed this in 1956. While in the seminary I wrote to him regularly and again in his first two years at Sydney University doing medicine. I may have an influence on him making up his mind or his contacts with the Jesuit Chaplains who influenced him in entering the Jesuit Seminary in Victoria. Cancer of the nose eventually prevented him to become a Jesuit. He was ordained a Rabaul Diocesan Priest in 1970(?) and dedicated his priestly life to the people of Tapo & Bitapaka. He must have waited for me to leave this world. Avelina and Joseph visited him on 26th January, Australian day. While there we turned the tape recorded on to play the "Ave Maria". He breathed his last then. I gave him the last blessing. I organized his burial at St Mary's Towers, Douglas Park.

Joseph M. Chow Sun Yau completed his priestly training at Croydon, Victoria. He served for 8½ years of Fruitful Apostolate in the Missionary Field of Eastern Papua. In those years he was greatly assisted in his apostolate in Milne Bay by his family and class of 1952. Alfie Woo and Francis Chan had been his most ardent supporters in fundraising.

It is with fond memory I write this, dedicated to all those in the Sacred Heart School and the Rabaul Chinese people who had influenced and shaped my life, my attitudes and my whole being. They had helped hugely in my missionary apostolate. We, together made a big difference in the schools and health service of the Catholic church in Milne Bay. The people continue to benefit even to 2007.

Thank you. Joseph M. Chow Sun Yau MBE.
