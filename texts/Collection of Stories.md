## SKETCH OF RABAUL ACCORDING TO THE PIONEERS

### John Achai

16 years in Singapore, then in 1897 served as a cook at Muiko Island for Mrs. Souz, a German. He came out 3 years before Grandpa Gabriel. After 2 years left service and opened shop and copra business in an island off Muiko, also for 2 years. He said: easily get 'skace' for plantation and cargoes from German bose who got them from Germany, no ships from Hong Kong yet. Maximum no. of Chinese was 30.

Then went back to China to procure a wife - back after 6 months - stayed at Muiko store for a year. Became cook in a ship in which he went to New Ireland Samoa etc. This is for a year. A 25 he opened "Landove" plantation at New Ireland with Ah Lok, his elder brother who came to New Ireland Britain 1894, the first or second Chinese to arrived.

He then stayed at Calais, his own plantation - easy labour.

### An Adventure

His boat was wreck at East side of New Ireland, went ashore lived there for 1 month then Grand-pa found his raft manned by a few natives, eventually found him too; then sailing boat was refloated by stripping bamboo poles onto the bottomless boat.

And plantation opened by Chow Lung or Loong, who was helped financially by Grand-pa to open Ulobo and Ulut.

During the period at the end of the war, 1917, there was 8 month famine, starvation, then peace. Australia came and saved the situation sold at cheaper price, it was as easy to get plantation as in German Time.

In 1930 came out of New Ireland. Lee Tam, the first Chinese, opened a general store: a company.

1994 German Admin. at Kokopo. During 1917 war, there were about 100 Chinese.

### Education - Schools

Seeto Koon opened some sort of school at Administration - Methodist songs and works. Catholics objected and started Yang Ching.

1921 prohibition of Chinese entry, there were about 300, no slavery in Rabaul; in Madang and in German times, yes. Germany had no soldiers here when Australian invaded the place.

### The German Occupation

At about 1804 the capital or the District Commissioner's residence was at first situated in Kokopo which was connected by a track to Matupit, Rabaul being bush then. In 1901 a few Germans in Matupit. At Kokopo 5, all a Bishop with his priests.

- 1903 wharf completed (in Rabaul)
- 1907 Admin. Transferred to Rabaul

Lee Tam was seemingly the first Chinese to come to Rabaul as a slave imported by German from Hong Kong. He was appointed by them to look after and control all Chinese whom he hired as builders from Singapore. The whole Rabaul area was once under control but when German occupation ended it was taken away from him. After a fruitful life he returned to Hong Kong. He died there at 75 years.

During the occupation restriction on entry of immigrants was enforced (but the cunning skill of the Chinese got passed that.)

### Chow Chew

1901 Rabaul was not yet opened. At Matupit Hanson's business of copra and store was opened.

Lee Tam married to a native woman had many kids; opened store and copra business on the other side of the bridge which formerly connected Matupit to the mainland. The store had 3 rooms, and one bar room.

On his arrival Ah Lok and Achai, Mr. Seeto as Carpenter. All Chinese from Singapore.

### English Occupation (Australian)

German occupied New Britain and New Ireland from late 19th to about 1914. The Great war began in more important parts of the world but these insignificant island also took part in the great calamity. For in 1914 and English Fleet came to invade this places. Some of these ships cruised around from Nodup to Kokopo for a month. In the meantime sending in scouts to found out the enemy strength. The germans were mostly civilians and being few in number, abandoned the town of Rabaul. And fled to Toma. They took with them all the money, and valuables to the mountain and with help of natives buried them. The situation being favourable to the invaders they attacked and occupied the Town, then they pushed on towards Toma. An English Doctor pedalling on the mountain was ambushed and killed by the Germans. These were punished by the soldiers (English).

### Chow Ying

Chow Loong, who was Grand-pa's brother and Achok's father, came to Rabaul but did not send letter home. Mum was worried and so Grand-pa promised to look for him. After 2 years apprenticeship, got letter from Lo Chin... whom he met in Hong Kong. (He went to Hong Kong by boat.) There he met carpenters and worked for 6 months; then being called by brother, he came to Matupit. Chow Loong after one year returned. (to China)

Germans were very good to Chinese. Natives still cannibals- previously two chinese got eaten in New Ireland two traders at Mission got killed. Then German came and revenge was taken.

At that time a yacht with millionaire sons went there for a holiday i.e. in New Ireland, as escorts were cleaning guns, cannibals came and speared a man. Reprisal then recovery of corpse. Natives constables were being trained at Kokopo, at this time.

A German who had a plantation at Tomaand was buying taro from the Natives previously, together with his German wife and a kid, cared for by a Samoan woman called Kai Lee met disaster. One day Miss Lee followed natives to work. Met wild natives with taro. The natives as they were weighing taro, killed the wife and kid with axe. When the man returned for tea as he approached saw house surrounded by yelling natives gallope off to Kokopo. Miss Lee hid in Toilet and thus escaped.

At Baining, New Massawa mission (before 1901) one priest, three sisters and one brother were killed. The priest picked up one native woman and her child. Reared him up and he was cook. One day the priest gave him a gun to hunt with he came back at the head of his old tribemen and murdered them all.

When Grand-pa first arrived he worked as native labour agent for Lee Tam, after one year, he was hired by Kokopo Admin. as carpenter then the bishop hired him to build Matupit Church. He saw plantation life, like it and worked in plantation a while at Karawe. Then back to Lee Tam's yard.

- At New Ireland Mo Ye Kay was first to open plantation.
- 1903 wharf completed.
	- To buy natives go to villaged but discontents came to force them to hire them and made arrangement with chiefs for rest.
	- All Chinese here had not capitable.
- 1905 back to China to procure Grandma. He came out to work when he was about 16 years.
- 1906 returned to new wharf at Rabaul.
- About 1907 Admin. transferred to Rab. After completion of wharf many Chinese came. German restricted flow of imnigrants to avoid unemployment.
- After Completion Etc...... 
- Gabriel Sing Yip is the first to be born in Rabaul..... 
- 1912 School opened by an opium addict. (?)
- 1916 a two-storey building, at the present side of Sing Yip, is put up.
	- Akun sons were taken out of this methodist inclined school and teacher (Buck Foon!!). They went to the makeshift school at Sing Yip which served also as library. Man Kai Kong and Wo Sam Ching were the new teachers from Hong Kong to replace Buck Foon.


### Raphael Chow S.J.'s Comments

Ah Lok was converted after the vision he saw at Church during Benediction - he went there out of curiosity primarily. He inquired about the religion in his sing-song, Chinese fashion, which gradually lead him to the fold of the Church.

Gabriel Chow Ying was the second convert in that area, Akun being first. Ah Lok followed very soon after that. Being mutual friends the vision affected all the first converts - they launched out into apostolic works among the Chinese. Gabriel perhaps can be compared to Paul of Tarsus while Ah Lok to Barnabus - for Ah Lok, after a while, (of apostolic work) retired to an island somewhere and led a very austere & Primitive life, going naked and sleeping in the sand. Whether he was led by religious sentiments or not, I'm not certain, but it seems probable that it was so. It was left to Gabriel then, to help organise firstly that reading room of a school in opposition to that methodist inclined school taught by Buck Foon. Afterwards he was among the foremost, if not the foremost, in advocating for a proper school staffed by nuns and Catholic teachers from Hong Kong. After a lot of negotiation they managed to get a Father Lau from Hong Kong as Parish Priests and (Rector of the New School, I suppose). The nuns arrived from Kensington Sydney and Yang Ching School began its short useful and dramatic existence - and war brought ruins to all the efforts of our forebears.

THE REST OF THE RELEVANT MATTER IS CONTEMPORARY NEWS AND I HOPE SOME HISTORIAN WILL PUT DOWN ON PAPER FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS TO LEARN FRON AND TO CARRY IN THEIR HEARTS A SENSE OF GRATITUDE FOR THOSE WO HAVE GONE BEFORE US. TODAY WE TOO HAVE SUCH A SENTIMENT FOR THOSE WHO HAVE ALREADY PASSED FROM THIS WORLD TO THEIR REGARDS IN THE HEAVENLY FATHER'S HOUSE IN HEAVEN.

## A MISSIONARY PROJECT

J. Madigan MSC.\
AUST. Annales - March 1926\
PP. 145 - 149

Rabaul is a pretty little town of well laid out streets bordered by tress and extends to the foot of high mountains. The white population is small, and is always changing. No one, save the missionary has any intention of remaining more than a short time, and then returning to home and friends in Australia.

From a missionary aspect, Rabaul has one defect, it lacks a Church, and consequently the work of instructing and ministering to the spiritual needs of the numerous natives and the less numerous Chinese, who have already received the light of Holy Faith, is particularly trying.

Rabaul is portion of a large missionary district embracing two stations - Rabaul and Matupit island. At present Holy Mass is celebrated in a small Chinese Hall, which has been kindly loaned by a few zealous Chinese Catholics; The Blessed Sacrament is reserved there, but I live in dread of a fire, which will deprive us of even this unsuitable building.

We have a piece of land situated in a central part of the town, and a Convent where four Australian Sisters, from Kensington, willingly and uncomplainingly spend their lives spreading the Faith in these tropical isles.

When will a little Church adorn the Ground near the Sisters' Convent and spare them the necessity of the long daily journeys to and from the Chinese Hall, When will the numerous natives, who sit, stand of cramp into every available space in the dingy hall, hear Holy Mass and the instruction in comfort?

Our architect - one of the missionaries - spent many long evenings after the fatigue of the day, in preparing plans for a suitable and becoming little Church, and I often wonder when it will be realised! The Sisters and the children pray that Our Lord may inspire some generous benefactors to help us to erect a suitable home for His Sacramental Presence, Yet a Church here costs but little. On account of the frequent earthquakes, anything but a wooden building is out of the question, and with careful and judicious spending a suitable building can be sex erected for a few hundred pounds.

Harbour excursions, as a means of raising funds, are out of the questions here. The native enjoys them every day in his own canoe. Dances, which are so popular in Australia as a means of reducing Church debts, would not give a like return here. The native is particularly fond of dancing, but he has not yet conceived the idea of paying for this pleasure, even when he would be sure that the proceeds would be devoted to erecting his village Church.

What then is a missionary to do? Personal inconvenience does not worry me, but I feel it keenly when I see my growing congregation cramped in the dingy little Chinese Hall every Sunday.

The resources of the mission are limited and heavily taxed, missionaries, priests, brothers and sisters - all over the vast vicariate have schemes and projects for the promotion and extension of our Holy Faith, but many things must wait, sometimes musics months and even years. So there is no immediate prospect of help from Vunapope. 

Come may feel inclined to ask what claim have the natives of New Britain on Aust. Australian Catholics? Well, these islands have now been acquired by Australia, and an Admin. is devising all kinds of means for the material well being of the natives. Naturally, then, a duty falls on Australian Catholics of bringing to the poor natives the greatest gift of all - our Holy Faith.

Australian Catholics are a missionary people, they are descendants of race whose watch word thro' the centuries has been to preserve amongst themselves, and share with others, the precious gift of a faith. Certainly then the natives inhabiting these islands clustered around Aust. have first claim on Aust. We can and must admire the success of the Catholic Missions in all parts of the world such is an instinct of Catholic life and spirit; but our first and obvious duty is to help those whose lands we possess, rule and govern.

Sometimes I think that perhaps a wealthy Australian magnate, touring these islands in search of health or change, will disembark at Rabaul, and will leave us sufficient to begin the projected Church, but so far he has not put in an appearance.

However, we are not forgotten in Australia. Recently a set of Stations of the Cross and little Monstrance have been sent us from the community at Douglas Park, While the Poor Clare Nuns at Waverley (Sydney) through so much in need of help themselves, have sent a cope for use at Benediction. Even these every necessary things were absent from Rabaul.

If we lack Material things we are compensated amply in a higher way. The religious fervour of the Catholics is very consoling. Frequent communion is gradually taking deep root among and the natives. Every Sunday a great number receive Communion, and their piety is remarked by all visitors.

Besides the natives in Rabaul, there are already a number of Chinese Catholics, and we have every hope that their number will increase as time goes on. The little school in charge of two Australian Sisters is now in splendid working order, and we feel certain that the influence of the sisters and superior training imparted in the school will influence many pagan Chinese parents to send their children for instruction. We have, of course, to conform ourselves to Chinese customs. On week days Holy Mass is celebrated three times in the Chinese fall, and on the remaining days Holy Communion is distributed. in order that the school children may have long hours for study. Holy Mass must begin at 6.a.m. Immediately after there is a short religious instruction, and then study until 5 p.m. it seems a shame that even tiny children are made to live this strenuous life in the Tropics, but it is Chinese custom and we must conform to it, although we do not approve of it. The Chinese appear to me to be a people absorbed in a desire for gain, but when they embrace the Faith they become very fervent Catholics.

Such is a brief description of the present state of the Church in Rabaul. A great deal has been done, and a great deal more regains to be done. How I wish that a little of that missionary spirit which is so strong and deep in Australian Catholics would be directed here? When I look around at my large congregation at Rabaul on Sunday, many of the natives are standing outside the door. Very often these poor people have come long distances fasting in order to receive Holy Communion. I promise them we will have a nice Church some day! but when I cannot tell. Perhaps some of the many friends of the mission in Australia will help to hasten that day, and also share in the prayers of the sisters and children for their benefactors. At least, pray for the mission, pray that the number of the native Catholics - now 25000 - may be increased in this vast victory. - pray that Our Lord may inspire some generous benefactors to aid us in providing a suitable Church here in Rabaul for his Sacramental presence.

## REJOICING IN RABAUL

By J.G. Madigan MSC.\
Aust. Annales Oct. 1926\
PP 530 - 532

A few months ago in a letter entitled "A Missionary Project" I laid before readers of the annals many of the difficulties which confront the Sisters of OISH and the missionary in the mission station of Rabaul in that letter explained that Rabaul is part of a large missionary district, embracing the two mission stations Rabaul and Matupit Island. Matupit is a very old station, and the people there are exclusively native. In 1883 the first band of missionaries - all long since dead - landed on Matupit is and began the vast mission enterprise which today extends for hundreds of miles, and embraces nearly twenty-six thousand fervent and well instructed Catholic.

Rabaul as mission station is of a recent growth. It was a swampy foreshore, chosen as a port on account of its deep water, and shelter for shipping. The natives of Rabaul are numerous, and, in addition, there are many poor pagan Chinese - the overflow of their own congested country - who are satisfied with their life of toil and hardship in Rabaul.

Mass is celebrated in a little wooden fall, owned by the Chinese, and crammed in between other wooden structures, likewise owned and inhabited by Chinese, this little hall also serves as a school, where the Sisters of OLSH who have come from Kensington teach the little Chinese children, it is a wretched place to offer to the poor sisters, but, being missionaries, they have come prepared to meet hardships. In addition to its inconvenience the temporary Church-School is situated a long way from the Convent and although walking in the tropics is far from bracing, still the sisters are always cheerful and never complain.

However, there are fears which energy can neither overcome nor remove. We live continually in danger of fire, which would deprive our numerous congregation of this poor building. Only a short time before I came to Rabaul, my predecessor waited during the greater part of the night fearing that fire in an adjacent building might sweep across and destroy his little Church-School. Adjoining the sisters' convent there is a suitable piece of land on which it was hoped we would some day be in a position to erect Church, but that day seemed very remote. The thought sometimes occurred to me that one of many tourists, who, by touring the islands, avoid the Australian Winter, would be inspired by Our Lord to leave us sufficient to begin our works; because after all, a church in the tropics costs only a few hundred pounds.

Well Our Lord did inspire, not a tourist nor a magnate, but a generous Aust. Lady, and her donation of £100 will bring closer that day which seemed so distant. The same mail which conveyed to us this welcome news also brought donations of £12 from other Australian, who appreciate what is being done for the poor natives.

As we hope to begin the Church towards the closed of this year - and when once begun it will be completed in about four months - Holy Mass will be offered in Rabaul Church every Sunday for all benefactors and their relations living and dead, and when the Church will be blessed and opened, Holy Mass will be offered every day for a month for the sane intentions. Benefactors will likewise share in the prayers of the Sisters and the children.

It is very consoling to the missionaries to know that Australian Catholics are taking such a deep interest in the work of evangelising these native races. Morever, it is certain that Our Lord will bless with abundant fruits the efforts not only of missionaries, but also those who have made sacrifices to assist them.

## RABAUL ADVANCES

By Rev. J. Madigan MSC.\
Aust. Annales. Feb. 1929\
pp 113 - 5

After years of patient waiting accompanied by the growing anxiety at seeing, Sunday after Sunday, and increasing congregation unable to obtain accommodation, Rabaul, the first and Principal port in the Pacific Islands has its own Catholic Church. Unlike the native village where Catholicity was introduced to, and spread among, a settled people, in Rabaul the present large congregation gradually grew around established Catholicity was nothing but a marshy swamp at the foot of a semi-circular mountain. It was unhealthy and inhabited only by millions of mosquitoes, but Rabaul had real advantages which gave it importance in the eyes of the white settlers. The Harbour was sheltered and its waters particularly deep, an ideal place for shipping. 

Once it was decided to form a settlement transformation was thorough and rapid. The swamps were drained and filled, the sheds of commerce began to rise and soon numerous cosmopolitan population had assembled. The whites were few and were either Government officials or the representatives of the business firms operating in the islands. Under the direction of the Whites large numbers of natives drawn from the different villages carried out all unskilled labour, while artisan occupations had to be entrusted to Asiatics - Chinese, Japanese and Malays.

The beginning of the Church in Rabaul was even more humble than in a native village where a missionary has at least space and bush material to erect his first little Church. Holy Mass was celebrated for months in a grass hut at the fear of a chinese store. Later on as the congregation grew, a zealous young Chinese (?) a recent convert - gave the use of a hall erected on his land. For more than six years this unsuitable building was the only Church in Rabaul, besides being used as a school for the Chinese children. The native population increased with the commerce of the port, while a number of chinese embraced the faith and together with, their families helped to increase the congregation.

For a long time past the Church school was quite inadequate to accommodate the people, and Sunday after Sunday it was very painful to witness a large number of poor natives hearing Holy Mass standing outside in the tropical sun. Moreover, we lived continually in fear that a fire would deprive us of what we had secured after so much trouble.

Now all worries are past. On Sunday, 8th April, Holy Mass was celebrated for the last time in the old Hall, and a young Chinese photographed a portion of the congregation immediately afterwards; a week later (Sunday, 15th April) the solemn blessing and opening of the new Church was performed by His Lordship Dr. Vesters, Bishop of the Vic. It was, indeed, a day of great joy for the whole mission, and everything seemed to contribute to its success. Probably in the history of the Island so many natives had never before assembled in Rabaul.

The solemn blessing and opening of the Church was fixed to take place at 8 o' clock. Dr. Vesters came from Vunapope, the headquarters of the Mission about twenty miles distant, and also a specially trained choir of native girls, under the direction of the Sister of the Our Lady of Sacred Heart.

Solemn High Mass followed the blessing ceremony and was celebrated by Rev. Fr. Baumann, a missionary of nearly thirty years standing and formerly missionary of Rabaul and Matupit Island.

It was really inspiring to hear the native girls singing the Holy Mass and extending to our Sacred Lord their first innocent greeting in his new home in their native land.

At the close of the Holy Mass a pioneer missionary from Malaguna, a neighbouring Mission station addressed the natives in their own language, explaining to them the real meaning of a Catholic Church and what the tower, the cross and the sanctuary lamp symbolise. He appealed to the natives living away from their native villages, in Rabaul, to be faithful to the practices of their religious duties and the lessons taught to them in the Mission schools.

Nearly all the white residents of Rabaul attended the functions and many planters journeyed long distances to be present. Included among the visitors were Rev. Nr. Barry (Anglican) the Rev. Mr and Mrs. Nargetts (Methodists).

After the religious ceremony those present assembled on the verandahs of the little presbytery for refreshments. Dr. Vesters presided, and in thanking those present for their sympathy and co-operation gave a little history of the difficulties in Rabaul and the origin and existence of the present Church which though still unfinished supplied a long felt want.

Rev. Mr. Barry addressing those present, recounted the impressions made on his mind by the work of the Catholic Mission on his first visit to the Islands last year. Really great work had been accomplished by the Catholic Mission in uplifting the native races. Continuing, Mr. Barry said he would repeat what he had told to his own Anglican Bishop, Dr. Long, of Bathurst, New South Wales, on his return to Australia last year - "There is only one Mission in the Islands, and that is the Roman Catholic. The Catholic Mission is a model for us all to copy."

The New Church, which is of Gothic design, is constructed of galvanised iron lined with timber and will accommodate about 500 people. The whole of the work from preparing of the plans to driving of the last nail was carried out by the Mission Brothers assisted by half-casts and native boys trained by them. The work is a credit to their ability and industry.

A Church in the islands is usually not expensive. On account of the frequent earth tremors it is not possible to construct a church in anything but iron and timber, while the excessive heat makes it imperative to have large open spaces. This Church was raised at the minimum of cost. True it is that the Church is still unfinished and unfurnished in the interior, but our greatest worry - lack of accommodation has been overcome and the prayers of the Sisters, their pupils, and large number of poor natives will be offered with the Holy Mass for the many kind & friends of the mission in other lands whose strong faith and love for our Divine Lord inspired them to assist in what has already been accomplished.

## RABAUL ERUPTION AND THE MISSION

J.G. Madigan, MSC.\
Aust. Annales 1937 August\
pp 310-311

Quite close to the south eastern entrance of Rabaul harbour is a perpetually restless volcano, called by the natives, "The Kaia". In 1878 when a few missionaries were practically the only Europeans in the scattered islands, forces buried in the earth and causing occasional earth tremors, eventually found a weak spot near the surface and opened out by shooting rocks and pumice high into the air. Even weeks later pumice and putrid fish covered the bay, and open crater known as the Kaia was the perpetual reminder of the catastrophe.

No accurate record could be gathered as the damage and loss of natives, because no roads opened up the hinter land, and the natives were as yet untamed, save for a few on the coast. During the long interval of 59 years, the Kaia never once became extinct. Its large open mouth emitting smoke and sulphur was something of wonder to all and fear to many. Many mission stations on Matupit Island lies at the entrance of the beautiful Rabaul harbour, and only a short distance west of the Kaia Again and again during the past thirteen years, accompanied by groups of natives, I have gone into the crater and watched the pure yellow sulphur crystals being deposited at the mouths of countless small openings. Frequently after heavy rain, which poured into the fissures of the crater, the Kaia has shown his resentment by violent earth tremor in the vicinity and by emitting evil smelling sulphur fumes. Never once did I suspect that the ugly monster would ever mark his displeasure again in a more terrifying way.

Almost direct north of the Kaia on the foreshores of the circular harbour is, or rather was, the pretty well-laid-out little tropical town of Rabaul, like nearly all tropical ports, Rabaul has a very cosmopolitan population, which siten work ceases soon divides itself into different groups, finding diversion and amusement in a variety of ways.

On Saturday afternoon, 29th May, practically the whole of the Europeans section of the community was out of doors carefree and lightly clad, no one had the least suspicion of what the immediate future had in store, it is true that earth tremors had not ceased since early morning, but no particular notice was taken of that, save but a few newcomers. Few were aware, however, that close to Vulcan Island, also at the entrance of Rabaul harbour, and only about a half - mile west of Matupit the earth moved restlessly, and in few places little; peaks of earth or rock came to the surface causing the water to recede.

At 4.20 on Saturday afternoon, a beautiful cone-like cloud, pure white and densely thick, shot rapidly up hundreds of feet into the air, gradually enlarging in its upward flight. At first it was difficult to observe whether it came from Vulcan Island or the sea close by.

Nearly the whole European population of Rabaul hurried out to get a closer view of the scene. Few among them had the faintest notion that within a few minutes they would be hurrying away as quickly as possible from the seat of danger. The cone-shaped column was for some minutes a glorious sight to see, and no one wanted to miss a moment of it. After spending its inherent force in its upward flight the cloud suddenly changed into a dark grey, folding one layer upon another. Almost immediately it was observed that the base of the cone ugly black rocks covered with dust were shot up into the air and were falling broken around the mouth of the newly formed crater. Scarcely had observers noticed the last change, when it suddenly dawned on them that what appeared to be harmless clouds of smoke or steams were heavily charged with matter no one knew what - and were moving in the direction Rabaul.

Crowds of poor natives noticing the agitated countenances of the whites hurried to the church and prayed aloud. Within a few moments all were hurrying to the hills that encircle the town only the few in fast moving cars succeeded in reaching the Gov. House, or the European hospital before the sudden darkness and falling pumice made further movement impossible. When the downpour of pumice sat started, total darkness enveloped the whole country. There was nothing elso to do except sit down. Fortunately the large stones shot up from the crater did not go far, but would the heavily falling pumice cease before we were all covered. No one could tell. The first fall seemed to last about half an hour, but unfortunately when the atmosphere became temporarily a little clearer, the dusk of evening added to the confusion. A few groups in cars made an attempt to go by eastern side of the mountain to Nodup, a native village more remote from the crater. They were trapped, however and had to remain in their closed cars on the road. Eventually almost the whole of Rabaul's population - 805 whites, 2000 Asiatics, and between 8000 and 4000 natives - found itself on the hills in and around the European hospital and Gov. House.

My district embraces the two mission stations - Rabaul and Matupit island. After hearing confessions from noon until 4 o' clock at Rabaul I was actually on my way to Matupit on my motorbike when the down pour came on. It is quite true I observed the beginning of the trouble before leaving Rabaul, but I had no idea it would be so extensive. Dividing my time and attention between the two places for more than thirteen years, I had grown quite accustomed to earth tremors, and although they were more severe and at times even violent at Matupit, still I did not fear nor suspect trouble. Craters belch forth stean after a few days of heavy rain. The Kaia was no exception. So why worry?

Perceiving that danger was imminent, I turned to return to Rabaul and secure a car or lorry to take the four sisters of OLSH to the hills. Alas; the quickly-formed intention was impossible of realisation. In a few moments I could not see a yard along the road. It was like suddenly out the lights in a well-lighted room. Some time later when the darkness had become less obscure, the sisters were brought to safety in a car by the police.

All through the night we waited impatiently for dawn. With loud sounds like thunder the newly formed crater was belching forth thousands of tons of rock and pumice, forming a high mountain around itself; but the pumice had ceased to fall, except in the immediate vicinity of the crater.

What was to be done with such an enormous crowd of people without any clothes, save what they stood in, and only a little food and accommodation. A road leads down the eastern side of the mountain, and from the village - Nodup on the coast. It was decided to transfer the entire population to Vunapope, the headquarters of the Catholic Mission, situated about fifteen miles by water over the open sea. Vunapope was the only place capable of feeding and housing the large population, and gladly did the administration and refugees avail themselves of the opportunity. The three mission boats, "Pablus", "Theresa" and "Kurindal," were first on the scene, and had actually made five trips with refugees before my other schooner or boat appeared, later other schooners joined in the work. The cargo boat, "Golden Bear" anchored near Nodup, and the Montoro, which had departed only the day before, was called by radio to return. Now numerous boats standing by could if necessary remove the entire population in a few minutes.

At Vunapope the whole mission with its large staff and numerous buildings were placed by His Lordship, the Bishop, entirely at the disposal of the refugees. The mission hospitals have for the time being Gov. Hospitals, with mission sisters who are trained nurses, co-operating with the Ad. nurses in attending the sick. Meals are provided at all hours and accommodation has been founds for all. Naturally strangers who have for the first time in their lives come into contact with Catholic life and influence are loud in their praise as to what has been done for them. The Administrator has expressed his thanks for the help and co-operation of the Mission.

At the entrance to Rabaul harbour are two open steaming craters, evidently joined under the earth's surface. The second the old Kaia, burst forth a bout twenty hours after the newly-formed crater at Vulcan Island opened. Although both have practically subsided now, still no ane can tell what the future will reveal.

With an administration permit I have four times visited the affected area. My two Churches still stand, but the people are scattered in all directions. Matupit now lies mid-way between the open craters. There are approximately 500 good natives Catholics on the island. Everything was in perfect order - Church, School, and well ordered village life. The administration is at present feeding through thousand of natives, whose grounds, it seems, will be unfit to grow foods for at least a year, or probably two. I have visited my people scattered in different places but can give them no assurance that we will be united again in our former places at Rabaul and Matupit.

## EXTRACTS FROM LETTERS TO SCHOLASTICS

Fr. Madigan MSC

In 1925 sisters from Kensington opened the Yang Ching School who now has a total roll call of over 130. All however are not Catholic but my congregation numbers a fair percentage of Chinese. Two Chinese teachers, hired from China also teach at different hours from the Sisters. In order to keep face as they say, they make the children work hard. We also had a chinese priest here for a while. ( Phillip Lau 1928 - 1934).

There are about 800 whites, 2000 Asiatics & from two to three thousands blacks in the town, perhaps just before the War II.

At present we are enlarging the Church here in Rabaul when complete the building will hold about twice the present number of whites, blacks and brindles. Now they cannot get inside the Church on Sundays. I am at present engaged in squeezing some of the "magnates" for a little cash, and so far I cannot complain. Sister Editha is on the Rabaul Staff at present, and is in charge of the Chinese School. The experience she gained with the Chinese on Thursday is has been advantageous to her work here. The Chinese in Rabaul are the best portion of my large cosmopolitan congregation. At present a commission is taking evidence on the advisability or the the "reverse" (?) of combining this place with Papua; with Papua as the seat of Government. No one seems to care about the commission. Already two old guns have been cemented on the crest of a hill just outside Port Moresby, in case the Japs come looking for an opening. The only thing that troubles us about the whole business is the effect it will have on the activities of the Mission. Adolf Hitler or Ole King Cole can take up residence here, if they will not interfere with the work of the Catholic Mission.

The old crater of Rabaul has been giving more trouble. When we arrived the sisters, Chinese and malayas and others were evacuated to safer parts and the place was in a very unpleasant state. The new Chinese school got a very great shower of pumice and all its external beauty has gone as well as half its pupils. These will return, possibly. Brass candle sticks, knobs, medals, Sisters' chaplets are ruined. The gases emanating from the crater have burnt or discoloured them beyond repair. The sisters' large rosaries are as if burnt in the fire and they have special rust proof chains for the tropics. People have great work trying to keep their dwellings clean, and just as things are a little in order the crater gives another cough and sends a fine shower of pumice over all.

Vunapope 6th Dec. 1941

"... Rabaul is fast becoming a city of death - The Volcano on its outskirts has been erupting for long periods since June and the dust and pumice and sulphur fumes have been pouring over the town, as a result, everything is desolate, great avenues of trees have been completely killed and there is scarcely a green blade or leaf to be found there. Every metal object has become tarnished, people are beginning to feel that if their insides are not yet affected they soon will be. Consequently the Govern. has shifted to Lae on the Mainland and the civilian population will soon be evacuated too. Unfortunately they are coming to this part and the new township will be adjacent to the mission - in fact will encroach into Mission property to the extent of 100 acres probably. This will be a bad thing for the mission who up till now has enjoyed the advantage of being at a comfortable distance from the town.


#### Madigan March 1925 Annales P 333

"while we were at dinner, a chinaman arrived in an old motor car and informed me that a poor halfcast girl was dying in a hut some miles away. After administrating the last Sacrament to the unfortunate I return to Rabaul .. for Benediction. Who was it?? the Chinese of Rabaul.

### CHINESE CATHOLICS IN RABAUL

Fr. Madigan

The Chinese in Rabaul, are pillars of the Church, and are increasing rapidly, so the future of the Church here is particularly in bright. Just recently we let a contract for the erection of a Chinese school, which will accommodate more than a hundred children.

We are also about to begin a school for Malays and half-casts in another part of the town; this school will provide for nearly two hundred children.

Chinese children begin school at 8a.m. and finish at 5 p.m. and after school hours they are anxious to learn wood carving, typewriting, shorthand, painting and anything else that will help them in their future business careers. I like the chinese and can quite understand that they are very interesting people to work amongst. Many of the adults never miss Holy Mass, even when it is raining heavily, and are daily communicants.

Like most people who have received the light of Faith through conversion, they cannot understand the lax lives of the bad catholics whom one unfortunately meets frequently enough here in the tropics.

Two of our Chinese boys from Rabaul are now in St. Joseph's College, Hunter's Hill, and others, of course, are in China. Next year the first from among the chinese of Rabaul will be ordained priest in China, so we will give him a reception when he returns here to visit his parents. This young man's brother is studying to be a Jesuit, and his sister made her perpetual vows as a nun last year. Check date of this in Aust. Annales..... 1st Oct. 1940 P 341.

## A NEW CATHOLIC SCHOOL FOR CHINESE CHILDREN IN NEW GUINEA

By J. Madigan MSC\
Aust Annales Dec. 1940

The Chinese in New Guinea are rapidly increasing people. Brought to what is now the Mandated territory in the early days of colonisation, the Chinese have by hard work, industry, thrift and above all, by being faithful to their Creator's laws grown into a numerous community.

The Catholic Mission was founded on Matupit on the Feast of St. Michael, 29th September 1882, and although the Mission soon widened its boundaries by founding numerous Mission Stations, still not one of the Chinese showed any inclination to examined the claims of Christianity for many years. The smiling Chinaman, whether in a remote native village or in his store at a port, was always friendly towards the Catholic Missionary, but no one sought instruction, and this was surprising. Now all is change. The Chinese Catholics in the Territory today are a numerous and influential community, and with good catholic schools under the Sister of OLSH and devoted chinese Catholic teachers, the future of our Faith among the Chinese in the Island is particularly bright. Many years ago a pagan Chinaman, Ah Lok, brought his brother 19 years younger to the mission school at Vunapope the headquarters of the Mission. Ah Kun, the younger brother, is now the prosperous merchant in the islands. Ah Lok wanted to place his brother in the school and wished him a to learn English for business.

In reply to a query from Sister Borgia, a Queensland nun at the school, if Ah Lok had any objection to his young brother embracing the Faith if he showed an inclination that way, the elder brother remarked, "Make what you like with him, as long as you teach and him good and give him plenty of stick." Ah Lok until the end of his life was a greater believer in the necessity of the "stick" in training children.

Young Ah Kun did embrace the Faith, taking the name of Aloysius, during one of his periodical visits to the Mission headquarters, Ah Lok attended Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament, and declared to the end of his life he saw clearly Our Lord as a smiling child when the Monstrance was raised for Benediction. Few of us who were happy enough to know Ah Lok in after years ever doubted his narrative.

Immediately he asked for instruction, and although in early life he had not the advantage of a good education, still he struggled hard to acquired a knowledge of the Catholic Faith. His baptism was deferred for some time because it was thought he had not sufficient instruction, but this only made his ardour grow. At last he was baptised taking the name of Paul. Rarely had the great St. Paul such an ardent namesake. Returning to his little plantation a long distance form the mission headquarter, Paul Ah Lok soon gathers around him a number of his pagan countrymen and instructed them for baptism. They were baptised by the Bishop, his Lordship Dr. Couppe. during one of his vists to Paul Ah Lok district. Paul Ah Lok is called today "The Father of the Chinese Catholics" in New Guinea. The title is well deserved.

Years later, Rabaul had grown into an important settlement, and as numerous Chinese had settled there, Paul Ah Lok wanted a little School (chinese) . Bishop Couppe assisted and a chinese catholic teacher was brought from china for the work, Paul Ah Lok and his family, who had in meantime all embraced the Faith, assisted in the erection and maintenance of the school.

After the beginning of 1925 three Australian Sisters of OLSH arrived in the mission from Kensington Sydney, to take charge of the school. Progress has been so rapid that the school soon became congested with the result that a new school had to be erected.

The accompanying picture will give some idea of the work being done at Rabaul. Nearly all in the group were baptised in recent year and as the Chinese marry young and remain faithful to their Creator Mandate, "Increase and multiply," we have only joy and hope in contemplating the future of the Faith in New Guinea among the Chinese. One of Paul Ah Lok's nephew will be raised to priesthood early next year, another nephew is studying to be a Jesuit, and niece has now made her final religious profession in a convent in China. Other prospective vocations to the priesthood and religious life are in sight.

The Chinese are a deeply religious people. Many are daily communicant, and their love for the Holy Souls is extraordinary.

Sister M. Blitha, the Australian sister now in charge of the school is faced with many worries in furnishing it at the present time.

Perhaps some lovers of the Mission and the work being done there under the such difficult may like to share in the Joy of bringing many more pagan children to the Faith by sending some help to the Sisters of OLSH in Rabaul.
