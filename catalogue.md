75 Glorious Years is a collection of tales written through the lens of the Catholic Missionaries who arrived in New Guinea alongside Germany's colonial expansion in the region. [Chapter 5](https://github.com/darrenpng/png-resources/blob/main/texts/75%20Glorious%20Years.md#chapter-v) is specifically about the Chinese Catholics in Rabaul.

I transcribed this book in full due to it's rarity and the physical copy (in my mother's possession) being in poor condition.

The majority of this article is an extract from [Chapter 5 of 75 Glorious Years](https://github.com/darrenpng/png-resources/blob/main/texts/75%20Glorious%20Years.md#chapter-v). It's possible that G. Church contributed this story to that book. This was printed in the [Annals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annals_Australasia), a magazine distributed by the Missionaries of the Sacred Heart (also known as *'Missionnaires du Sacr√©-Coeur'* or abbreviated to MSC).

The assumption is these stories were compiled by my cousin Joseph Chow who, at the time of writing, was an M.S.C. priest.

A recount of starting the first Chinese school (St Teresa's Yang Ching School) in 1925, and the first church in Rabaul. These institutions were destroyed by the [Tavurvur eruption in 1937](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabaul#Rabaul_(Tavurvur)_volcano:_6_June_1937_eruption) and the Japanese invasion in World War II. 

The Sacred Heart School was built in 1947 to replace the Yang Ching School.
